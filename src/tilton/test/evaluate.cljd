;;; --- The Pentagram of Death: a hard use case for data integrity ------

(defn pentagram-of-death []
  ;;
  ;; Christened the Pentagram of Death by Phillip J Eby, this
  ;; is the use case that challenges an engine not to calculate
  ;; and observe transiently* inconsistent values when two different
  ;; dependency paths of one prop (here :ee) lead back to
  ;; the same prop (:aa).
  ;;
  ;; * "Transiently" because the state change propagation eventually**
  ;;   gets :ee to the value consistent with the new state.
  ;; ** which is not
  ;;   good enough because observers may have already fired and produced
  ;;   side effects off the invalid state.
  ;;
  ;; The example is contrived but was contrived to replicate
  ;; a real dataflow failure that arose in my RoboCup simulation and
  ;; prompted Cells 3 and the concept of data integrity.
  ;;
  ;; For the telling story behind the useless prop names :aa, :bb et al
  ;; please see: http://smuglispweeny.blogspot.com/2008/07/aa-bb-cc-and-dd.html
